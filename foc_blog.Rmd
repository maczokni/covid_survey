```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

library(haven)
library(questionr) # https://juba.github.io/questionr/reference/index.html
library(dplyr)

```


```{r getdata, echo = FALSE}

# read in data
data <- read_dta("https://www.dropbox.com/s/o8f52y7iy1pxrai/Covid-19_Police_Study_W2_longprep.dta?dl=1")
weights <- read_dta("https://www.dropbox.com/s/ezndmkwasce4j5o/Covid-19_Police_Study_W2_weights.dta?dl=1")


data <- left_join(data, weights %>% 
               mutate(wt = weight) %>% # pick which weight to use 
              select(prolificid, wt), by = c("prolificid" = "prolificid"))  %>% 
  select(b_foc, b_focfr, b_focqol, b_focwo, b_prec, 
         b_prectyp_1, b_prectyp_6, b_prectyp_7, b_prectyp_8, 
         b_prectyp_10, b_prectyp_11, b_prectypo, b_precqof, b_precs, wt) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(-wt),as_factor)

```


```{r focfreqtb, echo=FALSE}

# foc_tab <- data %>% group_by(b_foc) %>% count(wt = wt) %>% mutate(perc = round(n / sum(.$n)*100,0))

foc_tab <- data %>% group_by(b_foc) %>% count() %>% mutate(perc = round(n / sum(.$n)*100,0))
```


In total `r foc_tab %>% filter(b_foc == "Yes") %>% pull(perc)`% of people said that they had felt worried about getting COVID-19 in the past 3 weeks. 


## Functional/ Dysfunctional worry


This is the table created by Jon's rules for Non-worried (foc = NO) and Functionally worried (worried about catching covid in past 3 weeks and quality of life is not reduced by worry and take precautions against catching covid and quality of life is not reduced by precaution and prec make them feel safer) groups, and everyone else as Dysfunctionally worried: 


```{r functionalfearjonvar1}

data <- data %>% 
  mutate(fearcovid = case_when(
          # Unworried
          b_foc=="No" ~ "Unworried", # not worried
          # Functional
          b_foc=="Yes" & # worried about catching covid in past 3 weeks
          b_focqol %in% c("Not at all", "A little") &  #  quality of life is not reduced by worry
          b_prec=="Yes" & # take precautions against catching covid
          b_precqof %in% c("Not at all", "A little") & #  quality of life is not reduced by precaution
          b_precs %in% c("Moderately","Quite a bit","Very much") ~ "Functional", #prec make them feel safer
          #Dysfunctional
           TRUE ~"Dysfunctional")   #everyone else 
    )


```


In this case I get the same table (almost, I found 3 extra people, need to check where they came from...!): 

```{r jontable1, echo = FALSE}

knitr::kable(data %>% group_by(fearcovid) %>% count())

```



But then I thought let's try to define the Dysfunctional group with logic too, so instead of saying all others are dysfunctional worried, I defined this group as: 

worried about covid and quality of life affected by worry but doesn't take precaution

OR

worried about covid and quality of life affected by worry and takes precautions but precautions don't work

OR

worried about covid and quality of life affected by worry and takes precautions but precautions affect QoL

Like so: 

```{r functionalfearjonvar2}

data <- data %>% 
  mutate(fearcovid = case_when(
          # Unworried
          b_foc=="No" ~ "Unworried", # not worried
          # Functional
          b_foc=="Yes" & # worried about catching covid in past 3 weeks
          b_focqol %in% c("Not at all", "A little") &  #  quality of life is not reduced by worry
          b_prec=="Yes" & # take precautions against catching covid
          b_precqof %in% c("Not at all", "A little") & #  quality of life is not reduced by precaution
          b_precs %in% c("Moderately","Quite a bit","Very much") ~ "Functional", #prec make them feel safer
          #Dysfunctional
          b_foc=="Yes" & # worried about covid
            b_focqol %in% c("Moderately","Quite a bit","Very much") & #quality of life affected by worry
            b_prec=="No" | #doesn't take precaution
          # OR
          b_foc=="Yes" & #worried about covid
            b_focqol %in% c("Moderately","Quite a bit","Very much") &   #quality of life affected by worry
            b_prec=="Yes" & #takes precautions
            b_precs %in% c("Not at all", "A little") | #precautions don't work
          # OR
          b_foc=="Yes" & #worried about covid
            b_focqol %in% c("Moderately","Quite a bit","Very much") &   #quality of life affected by worry
            b_prec=="Yes" & #takes precautions
            b_precqof %in% c("Moderately","Quite a bit","Very much") ~"Dysfunctional", # precautions affect QoL
          TRUE ~"???")   #everyone else 
    )


```


This leaves another `r nrow(data %>% filter(fearcovid == "???"))` people who aren't classified by these parameters:


```{r jontable2, echo = FALSE}

knitr::kable(data %>% group_by(fearcovid) %>% count())

```


So I had a look and tried to classify all of these people, and some do go into dysfunctional, but some do not, here is my thinking: 


**Unworried** 

not worried (same in all)

**Functional worry: **


worried about catching covid in past 3 weeks and quality of life is not reduced by worry and doesn't take precautions agaist covid

OR

worried about catching covid in past 3 weeks and quality of life is not reduced by worry and take precautions against catching covid and quality of life is not reduced by precaution and prec make them feel safer

**Dysfunctional worry:**

worried about covid and quality of life affected by worry and doesn't take precaution

OR

worried about covid and quality of life affected by worry and takes precautions and precautions don't work

OR

worried about covid and quality of life affected by worry and takes precautions and precautions affect QoL

OR

worried about covid and quality of life affected by worry and takes precautions and precautions do not affect QoL

OR

worried about catching covid in past 3 weeks and quality of life is not reduced by worry and take precautions against catching covid and quality of life is not reduced by precaution and prec make them feel safer

**??s:**

worried about covid and quality of life affected by worry and takes precaution but NA for these affecting QoL or safety

OR

worried about covid and quality of life not affected by worry and takes precaution but NA for these affecting QoL or safety


```{r rekavar}

  data <- data %>%
  mutate(fearcovid_reka = case_when(
            # Unworried
            b_foc=="No" ~ "Unworried", # not worried
            # Functional
            b_foc=="Yes" & # worried about catching covid in past 3 weeks
              b_focqol %in% c("Not at all", "A little") &  #  quality of life is not reduced by worry
              b_prec=="No" | # doesn't take precautions agaist covid
              #OR
              b_foc=="Yes" & # worried about catching covid in past 3 weeks
              b_focqol %in% c("Not at all", "A little") &  #  quality of life is not reduced by worry

              b_prec=="Yes" & #takes precautions
              b_precqof %in% c("Not at all", "A little") | # precautions do not affect QoL
            # OR
            b_foc=="Yes" & # worried about catching covid in past 3 weeks
              b_focqol %in% c("Not at all", "A little") &  #  quality of life is not reduced by worry
              b_prec=="Yes" & # take precautions against catching covid
              b_precqof %in% c("Moderately","Quite a bit","Very much") ~"Dysfunctional", # precautions affect QoL
            TRUE ~"???") 
  )

```

This changes the numbers to: 


```{r rekatable, echo = FALSE}

knitr::kable(data %>% group_by(fearcovid_reka) %>% count())

```
